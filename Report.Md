## Report

The purpose of our app is to allow users to play their favorite instruments and learn the notes in the musical scale in an easy and fun way. Users have the opportunity to select an instrument they are interested in and scroll play the different notes in the 12-note musical scale, hear what note name they are playing, and create music using the sounds. For the drumkit, users can experiment with 6 different drum sounds and create their own beat. The intended audience is visually impaired people who are interested in exploring musical instruments. The instruments are each playable using only the left and right arrow keys, space bar, and enter key on the keyboard. Page navigation is done fully through these keys and the backspace key as well. Upon navigating to each instrument page, the instructions for that page are read aloud unless interrupted by the user to begin playing the notes.
